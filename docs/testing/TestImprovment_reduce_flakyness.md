Spec auth_login_cart_delete.cy.js
## Debugging ##

Expected <a#nameofuser.nav-link> not to exist in the DOM, but it was continuously found. cypress/e2e/demoblaze/auth_login_cart_delete.cy.js:102:27 100 | // --- Logout --- 101 | cy.get('#logout2').click(); > 102 | cy.get('#nameofuser').should('not.exist');

DemoBlaze doesn’t remove #nameofuser from the DOM; it just toggles visibility. So should('not.exist') will fail because the element still exists, just hidden

## Solutio n##
Instead of assert for should('not.exist'), we use should('not.be.visible');

## Result after implementation ##

Spec catalog_pagination.cy.js 

## Debugging ##

sometimes the grid is still empty when we read it, 

Prev on the home feed isn’t guaranteed to restore the exact same set.

## Solutio n##
scope pagination to a stable category (e.g., Phones) and, after going back, re-select the category to force page 1. That makes the check deterministic.
